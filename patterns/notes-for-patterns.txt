3 things to do before solving pattern questions

1.How many number of rows are there in pattern
2.How many column is there in pattern (if it is triangular pattern then column<=rows
                                        for square pattern the number of column=n) // n is the number of rows given by the user as input.
3. What to print. What is the pattern we need to print if its a * or if it's a pattern with numbers then find the formula for printing the required patterm.
